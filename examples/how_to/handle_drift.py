# # Handle motion/drift with spikeinterface
#
# Spikeinterface offer a very flexible framework to handle drift as a preprocessing step.
# Please read this in detail, `motion_correction`.
#
# Here a short demo to handle drift using the level function See `spikeinterface.preprocessing.correct_motion()`.
#
# This function take as input a preprocessed recording and then internally run several steps (can be slow) and return lazy
# recording that interpolate on-the-fly tarces to compensate the motion vector.
#
# Internally this function do:
#
#      1. localize_peaks()
#      2. select_peaks() (optional)
#      3. estimate_motion()
#      4. interpolate_motion()
#
# All theses have many internal methods and many parameters.
#
# The high level function propose 3 predifined presets and we will explore theses preset using a very well known public dataset done Nick Steinmetz:
# [Imposed motion datasets](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/_Imposed_motion_datasets_from_Steinmetz_et_al_Science_2021/14024495)
#
# This dataset contain 3 recording and each recording contain neuropixel1 and neuropixel2.
#
# Here we will use dataset1 with neuropixel1. This dataset is the *"hello world"* of the drift correction in spike sorting community!

# every sub dict can be overwritten

# ### Plot the results
#
# We load back the results and use the widget to explore the estimated drift motion vector.
#
# For all method with have 4 plots:
#   * upper left: time vs estimated peak depth
#   * upper right: time vs corrected by motion peak depth
#   * The motion vector (average across depth) and all motion across spatial depth
#   * If non rigid the motion vector across depth is ploted as a map, color code the motion in micro meter.
#
# You can note on the figures:
#  * the preset **'rigid_fast'** has only one motion vector for the entire probe.
#    The motion is globaly under estimated because average across depth.
#    But the corrected peak are more flat then non corrected, so the job is partially done.
#    The big jump Ã  t=600s when the probe start moving is quitre well corrected.
# * The preset **kilosort_like** give better results because it is a non rigid case. the motion vector is computed by depth.
#   The corrected peak location is more flat than the non rigid case.
#   The motion vector map seems to be a bit noisy at some depth
# * The preset **nonrigid_accurate** seems to give the best results on this file. The motion vector seems less noisy.
#   Note that at the top of the probe 3200um to 3800um the motion vector is a bit noisy.
#   Also not that in the first part before the imposed motion (0-600s) we clearly have a non-rigid motion.
#   The upper part of the probe (2000-3000um) have a small motion but the lower part (0-1000um) do not have
#   and the method can handle this.

    # load

                   color_amplitude=True, amplitude_cmap='inferno',  scatter_decimate=10)
    fig.suptitle(f"{preset=}")

# ### plot peak localization
#
# We can also use internal results (peaks and peaks location) to check if peak putative cluster have a lower spatial spread after the motion correction.
#
# Here we plot peak locations on the probe (left) and the corrected peak locations (on right).
#
# The amplitude is color coded.
#
# We can see here that some cluster seems to be more compact on the 'y' axis.
#
# Be aware, there is two ways to corrected the motion:
#   1. Interpolate trace and detect/localize peak again
#   2. Remove bin by bin the motion vector in peak location
#
# The case 1 is used before running a sorter and the case 2 (used here) is for display only as  a checker.
